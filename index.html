        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>My name is Pedro Sosa, and I am a 38-year-old from Orange County, California, with a deep passion for designing streetwear clothing. For me, the creative process is more than a hobby; it's a source of genuine happiness. I've also begun to recognize that I am a great problem-solver, a skill I apply to many different situations. To channel these strengths into a new career path that feels like a perfect fit, I am currently learning programming.</p>
